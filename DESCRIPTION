Description: This package extends and updates the functionality of the original 
    package `randomizeR`. Adopting the tidyverse framework, it updates the 
    plotting and assessment capabilities. It provides beautiful reports and 
    figures. New functionality includes further bias assessment metrics
    and randomization-based inference. The highlights are the vignettes 
    and the shiny app.
